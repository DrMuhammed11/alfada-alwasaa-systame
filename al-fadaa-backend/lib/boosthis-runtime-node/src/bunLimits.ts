/**
 * WHAT THIS KIT CANNOT MEASURE ON BUN — and the words for saying so.
 *
 * These same bytes run on Bun. That is not a hope: they were run, as a real
 * Express app taking real traffic, under both engines, and every reading was
 * classified from that run. Most of the kit works on Bun exactly as it does on
 * Node. Ten readings do not, and they are all here.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST LIVES IN THE KIT
 *
 * A meter that cannot read what it needs does not crash and does not report a
 * wrong number — its reading is simply ABSENT, which looks precisely like an
 * app with nothing to report. So the list has to be somewhere, and it has to
 * be somewhere that cannot drift from what actually happens:
 *
 *   - the install recipe a Bun developer is handed has to say this UP FRONT,
 *     rather than let them find ten blanks weeks later;
 *   - their project page has to show these as not measurable rather than
 *     warming up forever, which is a promise we cannot keep;
 *   - the live proof re-derives the list from a real run and fails if it has
 *     drifted either way — something we call dead that turns up alive, or
 *     something that goes missing with no line here.
 *
 * All three read THIS table. It sits in the kit because it is a fact about the
 * kit's own meters on an engine, and because the kit's copy is the one that
 * travels to the customer inside the recipe.
 *
 * This module imports nothing, so anything may read it.
