/** Serverless-only readings.
 *
 * A function tells you things a long-running server cannot, and hides things a
 * long-running server shows freely. These readings are the first kind. Each one
 * ABSTAINS — `measurable: 0` plus a reason the server words — when the platform
 * cannot supply it, because a reading rendered as zero when we simply could not
 * see it is the lie this whole task exists to stop.
 *
 * What is measurable, and where:
 *
 *   • cold starts and their cost  — everywhere (this process IS a cold start)
 *   • initialisation time         — everywhere (already carried by startupImport)
 *   • the cost WE add             — everywhere; we time our own flush
 *   • measurements lost to a freeze — everywhere
 *   • time-limit headroom         — only where the host hands the function its
 *     remaining time (AWS Lambda's context, and anything that passes one). No
 *     platform states its limit in the environment, so without a context this
 *     abstains.
 *   • memory headroom             — only where the host states a memory ceiling
 *     (Lambda-backed hosts do; Azure does not).

 * Deliberately not a new serverless-only vocabulary: a second numbering would
 * render as a blank "not available here" with no reason, because the server
 * only knows this one.
 *
 * Only one code applies to these readings: neither a time limit nor a memory
 * ceiling is something the app can go and switch on. The platform either states
 * it in the environment (or hands it to the function) or it does not.
 *
 * Imported from the capability table rather than re-declared here — a second

/* ─── What the platform refused or killed ───────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * Runs that ended because the platform stopped them, and runs it refused
 * before the code ran at all.
 *
 * Three things here, and they are not the same thing.
 *
 * A WARNING is a run that came within the reporting slice of being stopped —
 * readable only where the platform hands the run a live countdown, and the
 * whole point of the reading: a run that vanishes explains nothing, and a run
 * that says "I am about to be stopped and I am waiting on the network"
 * explains everything. Plenty of warned runs finish anyway, so a warning is
 * counted as a warning.
 *
 * A DEATH is a warned run that never came back — the next run on this instance
 * began while the warned one had never closed its own books. That is evidence,
 * not a prediction, and it is the only thing allowed to raise a kill count.
 * A warning still open when the instance goes quiet is neither, and is sent as
 * unconfirmed so no surface can round it up into a death.
 *
 * REFUSALS we cannot see at all. No platform tells the running code what it
 * throttled or rejected before start-up, and we do not build a collector to sit
 * beside the platform and read its records. So that half is sent as null —
 * absent, not zero — with the reason, and with a flag saying whether the
 * platform publishes them in its own records so the surface can tell a
 * customer where to look instead of implying nothing happened.
