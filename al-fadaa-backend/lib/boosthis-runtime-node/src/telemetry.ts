/** Opt-in telemetry client for the Node runtime.
 *
 * Faithful port of `lib/boosthis-runtime-rn/src/telemetry.ts`. `enableTelemetry`
 * registers an invited Node/Express app with the central Boosthis server so it
 * appears in the maintainer's /admin dashboard, then reports — exactly like the
 * RN and Python runtimes:
 *
 *   - privacy-safe issue signatures (candidates) and fix resolutions:
 *     ALWAYS-ON once registered (not gated by the enable/disable toggle);
 *   - optional full per-route samples: only in full-telemetry mode, stopped by
 *     `disable()` / `issuesOnly`.
 *
 * Node has no production sampler (that is an RN-only concept), so issuesOnly
 * here simply means "never queue or ship full samples". The kill-switch
 * (`BOOSTHIS_DISABLED`) and `forget()` are the only things that stop the
 * always-on issue + fix channel.
