/**
 * "The server stored fewer rows than this app sent" — said inside the app.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The three upload endpoints answer `202` and then discard
 * individual rows they cannot store: a route label the shared privacy guard
 * refuses, a span past the per-trace cap, a snapshot entry whose name is
 * rejected. Until now the kit read that `202` as unqualified success, so a
 * developer whose every route label was being thrown away saw a healthy app,
 * no output, and a dashboard that was quietly missing data. The only way to
 * find out was for us to read the database by hand — which is exactly what
 * cost real debugging time during the Flutter live smoke.
 *
 * CONTRACT (identical in every kit — change it in one, change it in
 * all):
 *   - Read `dropped` and `droppedByCause` from an upload reply. Their ABSENCE
 *     (older server, non-JSON body, unreadable body) means "nothing to report":
 *     no warning, no crash, no guessing.
 *   - Warn EXACTLY ONCE per process per cause on the host's error stream,
 *     naming the cause and the fix. Never once per request, never behind a
 *     debug flag — this exists for the developer who does not yet suspect the
 *     kit, the same reason the "stayed inactive" line is ungated.
 *   - Keep a cumulative count + the causes seen, so the kit's own status page
 *     and bubble can show the size of the hole in the same words the web page
 *     uses.
 *   - Nothing here may ever fail an upload or reach the host's request path:
 *     every entry point is self-guarded and the reply is read after the
 *     response is already in hand.
 *   - Nothing is uploaded. The warning is local output only.

// per cause on stderr naming the cause and the fix, a cumulative count for the
// status page and the bubble, and nothing uploaded. Kept in this module rather
// than a new one because a developer asking "what is this app failing to
