/* ─── Boosthis: server-side meter collectors (Node) ──────────────────────
 *
 * Two label-free collectors that feed the `idle` and `latencyFloor` meter axes
 * (see meterAxes.ts). Both reuse the kit's EXISTING sampling boundaries — no new
 * background timer, no new interception layer, bounded memory — so they stay
 * guest-safe inside the host app.
 *
 *   • Idle efficiency — CPU burned while ZERO requests are in flight. The
 *     idle-window boundaries are the SAME request start/end boundaries
 *     liveDetectors already uses for its idle-burn detector; on each such
 *     boundary we fold the process.cpuUsage() delta and the wall gap into
 *     running idle totals (only genuine idle gaps — wall >= IDLE_GAP_MS — count,
 *     matching the idle-burn detector's gate).
 *
 *   • Latency floor — the worst completed fixed-length window's p95 request
 *     latency. Every recorded request duration is folded into the current
 *     10s window (LATENCY_FLOOR_WINDOW_MS); when a window closes we take its
 *     p95 and keep the WORST across a bounded ring of completed windows, so one
 *     terrible window is never averaged away by a good session.
 *
 * PRIVACY: durations, CPU ms, wall ms and counts only — never a route label,
 * host, or any customer string. In-memory only; no-op under the kill-switch.
