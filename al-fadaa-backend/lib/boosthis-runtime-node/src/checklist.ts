/**
 * The Boosthis checklist — Node.js edition.
 *
 * 115 Node-specific rules covering the most common Express / Fastify / async
 * I/O / event-loop pitfalls. Same shape as the Python checklist
 * (`lib/boosthis-py/boosthis/checklist.py`) so cross-runtime tooling can treat
 * any rule entry uniformly:
 *
 *   { id, title, whenToApply, evidence, category, languages }
 *
 * Previously this file re-exported the React Native rule pack as a stopgap.
 * Now the Node runtime ships its own corpus so `match_rules_for_code` against
 * a `.js` / `.ts` file returns advice that actually fits the runtime the
 * developer is on.
 *
 * The React Native runtime continues to import the 102-rule pack from
 * `boosthis-checklist` directly — it is unaffected by this file.

Fix pattern: `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING ... RETURNING` (Postgres) / `.onConflictDoNothing()` (Drizzle) / a guarded create — exactly ONE caller mints the credential; the loser gets a credential-less success response and the client MUST keep its existing credentials on such a response rather than treating an empty body as 'rotate mine'.

Symptom: once the original install is orphaned (it consented but lost or never stored its token), every later install that presents that SAME id gets a token-less 'success' forever — a permanent deadlock no server-side lever can break, because the server correctly treats the id as an already-registered identity. Rule: mint a FRESH unique id (a real `crypto.randomUUID()`) ONCE per logical install / instance, PERSIST it, and re-present that same id on every later start of that same instance; never copy an id from docs, another app, or a previous install, and never treat the id as configuration you can reuse — it is IDENTITY. The mirror-image bug is just as real: minting a new id on every process start (or every container, every replica, every cold start) makes each boot a brand-new install, so a clustered, autoscaled or rolling deployment registers dozens of one-request identities an hour, exhausts the provider's FRESH-registration cap, and gets throttled. \"Fresh\" means fresh per install, not fresh per boot — if the instance cannot persist anything, derive the id deterministically from something stable about the instance instead.
