/** The per-invocation lifecycle.
 *
 * A long-running server measures continuously and uploads on a timer. A
 * function cannot: the invocation is frozen the moment it answers, so a timer
 * scheduled during it never fires and everything gathered dies with it. The
 * shape that works is the one the PHP kit already proves — arm on first use,
 * keep what you gather for that invocation, and finish sending BEFORE the
 * invocation ends:
 *
 *     begin  →  the host's own work  →  response  →  flush  →  freeze
 *
 * Two ways to run the flush, in order of preference:
 *
 *   1. **After the response.** Where the platform can keep working once the
 *      visitor has been answered, we use its own mechanism — Vercel's request
 *      context `waitUntil`, the same thing PHP's `fastcgi_finish_request()`
 *      buys. The visitor waits for nothing.
 *   2. **Before returning.** Where no such mechanism exists (AWS Lambda freezes
 *      on return, full stop), the flush runs before the response completes, and
 *      the delay is bounded by a budget and measured on every single run.
 *
 * Nothing here is best-effort-and-hope: the budget is a hard ceiling, the cost
 * is recorded, and whatever did not get out is counted rather than forgotten.

 * On a platform WITH an after-response mechanism, no: the work is handed over
 * and the visitor waits for nothing. That is the only answer that costs a
 * visitor nothing, and it is taken wherever the platform offers it.
 *
 * Without one, the answer is yes on both shapes of per-run host, for the same
 * reason and with two different bounds.
 *
 * A REAL FUNCTION freezes at the completion of the response: an adapter that
 * turns an HTTP app into a function handler resolves on the response's own
 * `finish` event, the handler returns, and the platform freezes the invocation
 * with our upload still in flight. A flush hung off `finish` is already too
 * late, however carefully it is awaited, and the rows in it are gone with the
 * instance.
 *
 * A FROZEN CONTAINER stops getting processor at the same instant. Its rows are
 * better off — the process survives, so an unfinished upload is stranded rather
 * than lost — but a continuation scheduled at the response boundary does not
 * run: there is no processor to run it on until something wakes the container,
 * and on the harshest version of this host there is no afterwards at all. We
 * tried the other way and measured it: with the flush deferred, a frozen
 * container delivered NOTHING, and every row it had gathered sat waiting on a
 * timer that cannot fire.
 *
 * So the placement is not what was wrong on our own server. What was wrong was
 * the absence of a bound: 345 blocking flushes, an average of 329 ms added to
 * every request and one visitor who waited 10.3 seconds. A flush now runs under
 * a hard wall-clock ceiling that the deadline enforces INSIDE the upload as
 * well as around it; on a frozen container that ceiling is the shorter
 * `FROZEN_FLUSH_BUDGET_MS`, because there an overrun costs a delay and not a
 * row; and a container answering steadily flushes at most once a second rather
 * than once a request. Ten seconds is no longer reachable, the average is held
 * to a published figure, and what a flush could not finish is counted.
