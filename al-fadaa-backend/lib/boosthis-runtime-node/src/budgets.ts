/** Auto perf budgets — mirrors `lib/boosthis-py/boosthis/budgets.py`.
 *
 * This is the one Boosthis reading that is LEARNED rather than typed, so it
 * is held to the three conditions docs/decisions/adaptive-anomaly-detection.md
 * names: reproducible from stated inputs, explainable in a sentence, and
 * abstaining when under-sampled. The rule in full is
 * docs/learned-budget-contract.md.
 *
 * Three properties the earlier version did not have:
 *
 *  1. THE TWO WINDOWS CANNOT OVERLAP, AND THE BASELINE DOES NOT DEPEND ON
 *     WHEN IT IS READ. The baseline is the route's FIRST samples, kept by the
 *     ring module as they arrived; the window compared against it takes only
 *     samples stamped strictly later. Re-deriving both slices from the shared
 *     ring meant a busy route's "baseline" was the same few minutes as its
 *     "recent" — the app compared against itself just now — so a regression
 *     that built over an hour never tripped it. Capturing at arrival rather
 *     than freezing on first read is what closes that for a process nobody
 *     reads until the drift has already happened.
 *  2. WARM-UP IS NOT THE YARDSTICK. The first BUDGET_WARMUP_N samples of a
 *     route are JIT-cold and cache-cold. They are excluded from the baseline
 *     on that stated rule, so ordinary running does not read as "improved"
 *     against a cold start.
 *  3. A ROUTE WHOSE HISTORY WAS EVICTED SAYS SO, AND KEEPS ITS ROW. The ring
 *     holds 1000 samples shared by every route; a quiet route can be pushed
 *     below the floor and never climb back. That is a different answer from
 *     "still learning", and it carries what would change it. It is also why
 *     allStatuses() lists routes by what this process has MEASURED rather
 *     than by what the ring still holds — a route whose last sample was
 *     evicted would otherwise vanish from every surface before it could say
 *     anything.
 *
 * Both spans travel with the answer, and so does the name of the algorithm
 * that produced it: the phone and browser kits answer the same question from
 * a server-computed window instead, and a reader must never have to guess
 * which one replied.
