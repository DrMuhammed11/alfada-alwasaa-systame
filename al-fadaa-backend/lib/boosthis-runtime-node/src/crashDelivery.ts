/**
 * Whether a crash this kit captured actually SURVIVED — said inside the app.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A real Node service crashed, was restarted by its
 * supervisor six seconds later, and Boosthis reported zero crashes. Every step
 * of the fatal path was "best effort" and every failure of it was silent:
 *
 *   - the crash is written to disk synchronously, and a write that fails is
 *     accepted as a lost crash with nothing said anywhere;
 *   - the upload is scheduled asynchronously and the process dies first, so
 *     delivery can only ever happen on a LATER launch;
 *   - that later launch replays the buffer through a server that may refuse it
 *     — unregistered, unauthorised, rate-limited, revoked — and a refusal
 *     collapsed to "accepted nothing", which looks exactly like "nothing to
 *     send";
 *   - and the most common way a service dies runs no code of ours at all.
 *
 * A count of zero was therefore two different answers wearing one face: "your
 * app did not crash" and "we could not tell you that it did".
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE KNOWS
 * ------------------
 *
 * 1. **How the previous run of this app ended.** Each run writes an OPEN record
 *    and removes it on the way out (`beforeExit`, an `exit` from
 *    `process.exit()`, the SIGTERM handler in `exitFlush.ts`), or marks it
 *    `uncaught` when the monitor fired — in which case the crash itself is in
 *    the buffer and this record is not news. A record left OPEN by a process
 *    that is gone means the run ended with NO code of ours running: a SIGKILL,
 *    an out-of-memory kill, a hard container reap, a Ctrl-C, the machine going
 *    away. That is the one class of death nothing inside the process can ever
 *    report at the time, and it is the reason a crash-looping service can look
 *    perfectly healthy. It cannot be prevented, but it CAN be noticed
 *    afterwards, and this notices it.
 *
 * 2. **Whether a captured crash could be kept.** Memory-only state (no writable
 *    directory) or a failed write means a fatal crash dies with the process.
 *
 * 3. **Whether a replayed crash was delivered.** The refusal is recorded with
 *    the reason the server gave, so it is visible instead of silent.
 *
 * RULES
 * =====
 *
 * - Everything here is self-guarded and returns a conservative answer on any
 *   error. Telling somebody a crash was lost may never itself break the host.
 * - Nothing is uploaded from here. These are the kit's OWN words, on the host's
 *   error stream (once per cause, ungated — the same contract `dropReport.ts`
 *   keeps), on `/_boosthis/status`, and in the `/_boosthis` answer an AI reads.
 * - Nothing here decides that a crash HAPPENED. An unclean ending is reported
 *   as what it is — a run that ended without a word — and never counted as a
 *   crash class, because we do not know what killed it and we will not invent
 *   a signature for it.
 * - Several processes of one app share one state file, so a run record carries
 *   its owner and a process only ever resolves a record whose owner is gone.
