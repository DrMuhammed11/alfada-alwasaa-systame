/**
 * The standalone "is Boosthis working?" page — the one surface a back-end
 * developer can open when their app has no UI at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The floating bubble proves the kit is alive by riding along
 * on a page the app already serves. An API with no HTML has nowhere to put it,
 * so the developer installs the kit, sees nothing, and reasonably concludes the
 * product is broken. This page is the answer: one self-contained HTML document,
 * served by the kit on the HOST APP'S OWN PORT, that states plainly whether the
 * kit registered, whether anything is being uploaded, and — when the answer is
 * no — why not.
 *
 * CONTRACT (identical in the Node, Python, Go, Java, PHP, .NET and Ruby kits —
 * change it in one, change it in all):
 *   - Path:    `<prefix>/status`, canonically `/_boosthis/status`.
 *   - Guard:   the kit's STRICT loopback guard, the same one `/account` uses
 *              (direct loopback TCP peer AND no proxy/forwarding headers). It
 *              is NOT opened by `allowRemote`, and it is NOT a new auth surface
 *              — a remote request gets 403 and learns nothing.
 *   - Body:    server-rendered HTML with inline CSS, NO JavaScript, NO network
 *              calls, NO external assets. The page has to work in exactly the
 *              situation where everything else is broken.
 *   - Secrets: the install id is shown (it is an opaque identifier the
 *              dashboard also shows); the delete token and read token are
 *              NEVER rendered here. Credentials stay on `/account`.
 *   - Honesty: the headline and explanation come from the SAME ordered state
 *              machine as the bubble's panel notice (rejected -> not
 *              registered -> sharing off -> UPLOADS FAILING -> measuring),
 *              with the same wording, so a developer never gets two different
 *              stories.
 *
 * NOTE ON PARITY: all five states now exist in every kit. `uploads-failing`
 * was the newest and lived here alone for a while: the other thirteen kits
 * reported a refused batch as nothing at all — they kept showing the last
 * SUCCESSFUL upload while every later batch was thrown away — and a customer
 * lost a day of data to exactly that on 22 Aug 2026. The state, its closed
 * four-reason set and both extra rows were carried across to all of them; the
 * shared wording is pinned by scripts/src/__tests__/kit-inactive-honesty.test.ts
 * and scripts/src/__tests__/server-kit-status-page.test.ts.
