/* ─── Boosthis: long-lived connection watcher (Node) ──────────────────────
 *
 * The server half of the Live Connections axis. Everything else this kit
 * measures is a request that STARTED and FINISHED. A chat socket, a live
 * dashboard feed, a presence channel or a streamed AI answer does neither for
 * minutes at a time, so a server holding four thousand dead sockets and a
 * server holding four thousand busy ones look identical in every other reading.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF CONNECTION ARE SEEN, and they are seen differently:
 *
 *   1. UPGRADED SOCKETS (WebSocket and anything else that upgrades). Caught at
 *      `http.Server`'s own `upgrade` event, so the socket is seen whichever
 *      library goes on to speak the protocol on it. We never read a byte of it:
 *      liveness comes from sampling the socket's own `bytesRead`/`bytesWritten`
 *      counters, which costs nothing and cannot take data away from the library
 *      that owns the stream. Because we watch bytes and not frames, MESSAGE
 *      COUNTS ARE NOT KNOWABLE for these — the axis says so rather than
 *      guessing.
 *   2. SERVER-SENT STREAMS. Caught in the middleware, by content type, on the
 *      first write. Here the app itself marks the boundaries, so messages ARE
 *      countable.
 *
 * GUEST SAFETY: the `upgrade` patch always forwards; no listener is added that
 * could change stream mode; every callback body is guarded; the sampler timer
 * is `unref`-ed so it can never hold a process open; installation is
 * idempotent and fully undone by `clearLiveConnections()`.
 *
 * PRIVACY: counts, byte TOTALS, durations. Never a URL, header, address, frame
 * or payload. The endpoint a connection points at is folded to a 32-bit number
 * in memory purely to group reconnects, and is never uploaded.
