/* ─── Boosthis: process & diagnostics meter collectors (2026-08, batch 2) ──
 *
 * The 13 remaining honest Node meters from the toward-50 research
 * (suggestions/meter-research-toward-50-2026-08.md, Node section). Same
 * doctrine as extraMeters.ts / runtimeVitals.ts: ADDITIVE display-only axes
 * that never feed the Speed score, counts/durations/coarse buckets only
 * (never a name, URL, payload or value), bounded memory, honest omission
 * while warming or when the environment cannot provide the signal, and every
 * collector guest-safe (never throws into the host, no-op under the
 * kill-switch, no background pollers — sampling rides existing request /
 * snapshot boundaries).
 *
 * Always-on (warm with ordinary uptime — the server renders them as
 * "warming up" tiles until the gate passes):
 *   • cpuConsumption   — process CPU time vs wall time (resourceUsage).
 *   • residentGrowth   — resident-set slope, catches native growth V8 hides.
 *   • nativeMemoryMix  — external + ArrayBuffer share of the RSS footprint.
 *   • uptimeStability  — wall-clock vs process.uptime() drift (suspends).
 *   • heapSpacePressure— the most-occupied individual V8 heap space.
 *   • codeCachePressure— V8 code + bytecode metadata footprint.
 *   • arrayBufferRetention — retained ArrayBuffer floor + growth.
 *
 * Env-gated (honestly absent unless the host opts in — never a warming tile):
 *   • eventLoopDelayTail / eventLoopDelayMax — BOOSTHIS_EVENT_LOOP_HISTOGRAM=1
 *     (a second monitorEventLoopDelay histogram, windowed p95/p99 + worst).
 *   • perfEntryBacklog — BOOSTHIS_PERF_ENTRIES=1 (unconsumed performance
 *     entries; length only, entries are never read).
 *   • asyncResourceDiversity — BOOSTHIS_ASYNC_RESOURCE_TYPES=1 (distinct
 *     async resource TYPE count; types are never uploaded, only the count).
 *   • diagnosticErrorVolume / diagnosticActivity — BOOSTHIS_DIAGNOSTICS=1
 *     plus an explicit BOOSTHIS_DIAGNOSTICS_CHANNELS allowlist (counts only;
 *     event payloads are never touched, channel names never leave the
 *     process).
 *
 * Dropped from the research list, with reasons (task requires them written):
 *   • #12 Async Context Loss, #15 Worker Utilization Spread, #16 Worker
 *     Message Backlog, #17 Undici Pool Queueing, #19 Trace-Event Throughput —
 *     parked in the research doc itself: each needs host integration or
 *     global tracing state a drop-in kit must not take.
 *   • #18 HTTP Agent Socket Balance — requires the host to register its
 *     http.Agent objects with the kit; under the drop-in rule that is the
 *     same class of shim as #17, so it is parked, not shipped.
 *   • #20 Active Resource Composition — getActiveResourcesInfo()'s coarse
 *     type mix restates the existing active-handle growth axis plus
 *     asyncResourceDiversity's type-count signal; shipping it as a third
 *     tile would be the padding the research doc forbids.

// to meet demand, so a space in use is a space that is nearly full. Measured
// on an idle process at boot, then holding ~100 MB, then under heavy
