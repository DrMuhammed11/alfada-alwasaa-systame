/** Attach Boosthis's in-app page and read-only JSON endpoints to an existing
 * Express app.
 *
 * Mirrors the Python `boosthis.mount(app)` helper. Endpoints are:
 *
 *   GET /_boosthis/          — the in-app page (the ONE page every kit serves)
 *   GET /_boosthis/dev       — this kit's detailed local view (loopback-only)
 *   GET /_boosthis/healthz   — version + sample count
 *   GET /_boosthis/summary   — aggregate p50/p95/p99 + per-route worst rating
 *   GET /_boosthis/recent    — most recent samples (default 50)
 *   GET /_boosthis/budgets   — auto-learned budgets + regressions
 *
 * All endpoints are read-only and share the in-process sample buffer with
 * the middleware, so mounting alone does not record anything new — make
 * sure you also `app.use(boosthis())`.
 *
 * WHAT EACH READ ANSWERS IS NOT DECIDED HERE. The status, the body and the
 * gate all come from `answerKitRead` in kitAnswers.ts, which the middleware
 * and the framework-free attach dispatch to as well. This module's only job is
 * to register the Express routes and to write the answer the Express way.
 * That split is deliberate: while each door decided for itself, the mounted
 * `/panel` route handed out meter values that the middleware withheld behind
 * a kill-switch lock, so the same app answered differently depending on which
 * door a request happened to reach first.
 *
 * TWO pages, deliberately:
 *
 *  - `/_boosthis` is the canonical in-app page — the same markup every other
 *    kit serves (generated from lib/kit-page/panel_page.html), so a developer
 *    who has seen it in one language recognises it in all of them. It carries
 *    no measurements of its own: it fetches the closed `/panel` read beside it,
 *    and rides the SAME visibility as that read (ungated) — gating the page
 *    while leaving its only data source open would protect nothing.
 *  - `/_boosthis/dev` is this kit's older, richer local view: per-route table,
 *    learned budgets, recent samples and the "Connect your AI" card. That view
 *    shows route labels and a credential, so it keeps the loopback guard the
 *    whole dashboard used to have, along with every JSON endpoint it reads.

 * our code shows the customer's own visitor the customer's error page (or, in
 * development, our stack trace on their site). That is the kit intervening in

 *
 * Same shape the Go kit uses (`defer recover()` at the top of every serve

 * caller expects — the kit's own page for an HTML route, a JSON body for a
 * JSON read — so the browser or the bubble gets a well-formed reply instead of
 * a hung request.
 *
 * Two rules borrowed from our own site's safety net:
 *   - if the head is already on the wire, leave the response alone; rewriting
 *     it corrupts a reply the caller is already reading;
 *   - the apology must not be able to fail, so writing it is guarded too.
 *
 * This wraps only routes the KIT registered. The host's own handlers are never
