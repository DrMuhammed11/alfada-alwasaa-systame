/* ─── Boosthis: extra Node meter collectors (2026-08 batch) ──────────────
 *
 * Four more honest, display-only meters. Same doctrine as runtimeVitals.ts:
 * ADDITIVE axes that never feed the Speed score, counts/durations only (never
 * a route, URL, host, or user value), bounded memory, honest omission while
 * warming up or when the signal is environment-dependent, and every collector
 * guest-safe (never throws into the host, no-op under the kill-switch).
 *
 *   • Handle churn — sockets/timers created at a furious rate burn CPU
 *     without ever looking like a leak (handleLeak only sees NET growth).
 *     Counted via a minimal async_hooks init hook filtered to handle-shaped
 *     resource types; per-minute rate over a rolling window.
 *   • Promise-rejection pressure — rejections handled LATE (the silent class:
 *     'rejectionHandled' is a fully passive listener) plus unhandled-rejection
 *     process warnings ('warning' listeners never suppress Node's own
 *     printing). We NEVER add an 'unhandledRejection' listener — that would
 *     suppress the host's default crash behavior (see crashReporter.ts).
 *   • Slow-client backpressure — the share of responses whose socket write
 *     buffer filled at least once (the response emitted 'drain'). Separates
 *     "our server is slow" from "their client is slow".
 *   • Worker imbalance — with several cluster workers, is one carrying
 *     everything? Workers piggyback a tiny numeric count message on the
 *     request boundary (no background timer); the PRIMARY's kit aggregates
 *     shares. Environment-dependent: no cluster → the axis is honestly absent
 *     forever (never a warming tile).
 */

/* Node built-ins are reached through STATIC imports, never `require`. This kit
 * ships as ESM (`"type": "module"`, copied to the customer as-is), and in ESM
 * there is no `require` — so a lazy CommonJS load of a `node:` built-in inside
 * one of the defensive try/catch blocks below threw on the customer's very
 * first call and left the meter behind it silently reporting nothing, forever.
 * See __tests__/esmBuiltinAccess.test.ts, the guard that keeps it that way. */

 * Deflection Rate + Factor of Safety: does the app "bend" under concurrent
 * load? At the START of each request we note how many requests are in flight;
 * on completion we file the duration into a fixed bucket chosen by that
 * in-flight count. Comparing the p75 duration of a low-concurrency bucket to a
 * high-concurrency bucket shows how much latency degrades as load rises.
 *
 * HONEST CLAIM — this is a CORRELATION, not causation. The requests in the
 * quiet and busy buckets are NOT the same routes, so a higher ratio is an
 * OBSERVED "busy vs quiet" latency difference, not proof that concurrency
 * itself caused the slowdown (a busy period may also happen to hit heavier
 * endpoints). Captions say "measured"/"observed busy vs quiet" and never claim
 * concurrency CAUSED the change.
 *
 * OVERHEAD CEILING: exactly one integer increment on start and one decrement
 * on end (Node is single-threaded — the ++/-- are atomic without a lock), plus
 * a fixed-size bucket array. Durations are pushed into a bounded per-bucket
 * ring; no other per-request allocation. Counts + durations only — NEVER a
 * route, URL, host, or any customer value.
 *
 * COUNTER SAFETY: the in-flight counter must NEVER leak. Every start that is
 * counted returns a token; the matching end decrements UNCONDITIONALLY (the
 * decrement sits outside any enabled/started check and outside the recording
 * try), so a kill-switch flip, an early return, or an exception between start

 *
 * A value written in a placeholder form is, by construction, the ABSENCE of a
 * credential: it is what a message prints where a credential would go. The two
 * shapes that read a free-form value — bearer and the named api-key/secret/
 * token value — are the only ones that can meet one, because the other three
 * match a fixed alphabet a placeholder cannot satisfy.
 *
 * This narrowing was written after our own site's Leak Watch reported 50
 * secret-class detections an hour, every one of them the string
 * "Authorization: Bearer <project-key>" inside our own 403 body telling a
 * caller HOW to send its key. Counting an instruction as a leak makes the tile
 * unactionable for us and for every customer who documents an auth header in
 * an error reply, which is the ordinary thing to do.
 *
 * The set is deliberately small and closed: bracketed forms, template
 * expressions, redaction runs, and the handful of ALL-CAPS stand-in words. It
 * is NOT a general "looks unimportant" filter — anything outside it is still a
 * detection. Widening it would hide real leaks, so a future change here needs
 * the same kind of evidence this one has. See docs/leak-detection-vocabulary.md.
 *
 * The pattern anchors at the START of the value and then allows only
 * NON-VALUE characters to the end, because the value a shape captures runs to
 * the next space and so drags whatever punctuation the surrounding sentence or
 * JSON encoding put there ("Bearer <project-key>)\"}"). A real credential can
 * still follow a bracketed form — "<x>realkey123456" is not a placeholder,
 * because the tail is made of value characters.
 *
 * The word forms are matched CASE-SENSITIVELY in caps, which is how a document
 * writes a stand-in. Lower-case "mytoken…" or "sample…" is a plausible real
 * credential prefix and stays a detection.

 *  Known limit, stated rather than papered over: an app that answers bad
 *  credentials with 403 from its own matched login route lands in the protocol

 *
 * OBSERVATION, NOT A VERDICT. This axis counts refusals and reports what shape
 * they had; it never scores or rates them, and it must not start doing so.
 *
 * Why: at this boundary the kit can see that a request carried an
 * authorization header and that the refusal carried a challenge — it CANNOT
 * see whether the credential was understood. A 401 with a challenge is the
 * correct answer to an expired, revoked or mistyped credential, so a score
 * built on these counts would fault an app for behaving correctly. The counts
 * are still worth reporting (they are the only view anyone has of who is being
 * turned away), so they ship with `score: null`, `rating: "not-scored"` and a
 * caption that says in words that this is an observation.
 *
 * The rating is the point. "pending" is the word for a score that has not been
 * earned YET, and this one never will be — a reader with full source access
 * once filed a correct ten-minute observation as a defect ("counted everything
 * correctly but remained pending") because that was the only word we gave him.
 * "not-scored" says permanently, by design, and the server writes the sentence.
