/* ─── Boosthis: event-loop lag axis (Node) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A fifth honest, display-only meter for the Node dashboard: how long the event
 * loop is *delayed* beyond its scheduled tick. Event-loop delay is the single
 * truest signal of a blocked/overloaded Node process — a sync `fs` call in a
 * handler, `JSON.parse` on a huge body, a tight CPU loop, or GC pressure all
 * show up here even when the per-route timer sees nothing (that timer only
 * measures the handlers Boosthis wraps; loop lag also catches burn BETWEEN
 * requests and inside un-instrumented callbacks/timers).
 *
 * SOURCE: Node core's `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay()` native histogram — a
 * libuv timer sampled every `RESOLUTION_MS` in C++ with negligible overhead.
 * There is NO background JS poller (Boosthis's own rule book forbids idle
 * spinners); the histogram is maintained natively and only READ on demand when
 * a snapshot is captured, so the meter never itself burns idle.
 *
 * HOST-SUSPEND HONESTY: a scale-to-zero host suspends the container between
 * requests, so the libuv timer fires tens of seconds late during idle gaps and
 * the histogram would record a monster "freeze" no user ever felt. Via the
 * shared suspend sensor, growth of the histogram max that happened ENTIRELY
 * inside a suspicious idle gap is attributed to suspend: the poisoned samples
 * are purged (histogram reset; clean traffic-time worst + sample counts are
 * carried forward) and the axis reports `suspendDiscounts` /
 * `suspendWorstMs` so the discount is visible, never silent. A stall DURING
 * traffic still lands in the histogram and still turns the tile red.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the axis carries ONLY numbers (p50/p99/max loop delay in ms, a
 * sample count, a 0..100 score, suspend-discount counts) plus a fixed rating
 * bucket — never a route name, value, timestamp of user activity, or source.
 * It rides inside the existing snapshot upload and clears the same PII guard
 * as every other field.
 *
 * Node↔Python parity: Python has no libuv loop, so its sibling
 * (`event_loop_lag.py`) measures asyncio scheduling delay and only when an
 * event loop is actually running (async apps); a sync WSGI app simply omits the
 * axis, exactly as this module omits it when the histogram is unavailable or
 * has too few samples.

 *
 *  WHY THESE NUMBERS (re-banded 2026-09; previously 150ms good / 2000ms poor).
 *  A block on this loop is not one slow request. The process answers NOBODY for
 *  its whole duration, so every request already in flight and every one that
 *  arrives during it pays the entire block on top of its own work. The bar
 *  therefore comes from what a stalled caller pays, not from what a single
 *  handler may reasonably take:
 *    · ≤100ms — the long-standing "feels instant" ceiling for a response to a
 *      deliberate action. A block inside it is one no caller can pick out.
 *    · ≥1000ms — a full second in which the process answered no one. Nothing
 *      about that is smooth, at any traffic level.
 *  The old band demanded a TWO-SECOND block before it would say "poor" and held
 *  "good" up to ~437ms: a Node process frozen for very nearly half a second,
 *  rated smooth. On this band the score leaves "good" at 240ms — deliberately
 *  just under the 250ms LAG_POOR_MS above already calls a clearly blocked loop,
 *  so the two axes agree about when this loop is in trouble instead of one of
 *  them waiting for the other to be eight times worse. */

 *  reading. The difference between a rare hiccup and a process stalling every
 *  five seconds was invisible by construction, and frequency is the half that
 *  decides whether a caller ever meets one.
 *    · ≤1/min — a quarter-second block once a minute is a hiccup most callers
 *      never hit.
 *    · ≥12/min — one every five seconds. A caller making a request a second
 *      meets a stalled process roughly every fifth request, and the loop is
 *      unresponsive for at least 5% of the time it is watched.
 *
 *  ONE VERDICT, AND IT IS THE WORSE HALF. A single very long freeze is bad on
 *  its own; so is a stream of shorter ones. Averaging the two lets either hide
 *  the other, so the axis scores `min(severity, frequency)` and the raw values
