/* ── What each route looked like when it ARRIVED ───────────────────────────

 * holds for one route is whatever survived the others' traffic. Anything that
 * wants a route's FIRST samples — the learned budget's baseline does — cannot
 * get them from the ring: on a busy app the oldest surviving sample of a route
 * is minutes old, so a "baseline" drawn there is the app compared against
 * itself just now, and drift is invisible by construction.
 *
 * Reading them at arrival is the only way that holds. It is done HERE rather
 * than by a reader registering a callback, because a callback only starts
 * catching samples when its module happens to be imported: an app that runs
 * for an hour before anything reads a budget would hand the first read the
 * same minutes-old window. This record exists from the first sample, whoever
 * reads it and whenever.
 *
 * BOUNDED. At most MAX_TRACKED_ROUTES routes are kept, each with at most
 * ROUTE_HEAD_SAMPLES samples; a long-running process with high-cardinality
 * labels drops the least-recently-seen route rather than growing without
 * limit. A dropped route's head restarts from its next sample, so it reads as
 * learning again — never as a stale yardstick.
