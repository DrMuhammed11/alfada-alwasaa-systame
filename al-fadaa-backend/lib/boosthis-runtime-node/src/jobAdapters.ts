/* ─── Boosthis: attaching to the job systems an app already uses ───────────
 *
 * The background-work meter can always be driven by hand, but a developer who
 * has to wrap every job themselves will wrap the three they remember and miss
 * the twelve that matter. This module finds the job systems the app ALREADY
 * loaded and measures their runs without a line of wiring.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS MODULE OBEYS ABOVE ALL OTHERS: never load anything the app did
 * not choose itself. Every check here reads Node's module cache and pulls back
 * an object that is ALREADY there. Nothing is `require`d, nothing is resolved
 * from disk, and an app with no queue library pays nothing but a cache scan.
 * Pulling in a queue library on the customer's behalf would change what their
 * process does, which is not a meter's job.
 *
 * WHAT IT ATTACHES TO, and why those:
 *   • bullmq    — the Redis-backed queue most Node back ends reach for.
 *   • pg-boss   — the same idea on Postgres, for a project that already has one
 *                 database and does not want a second.
 *   • node-cron — the in-process scheduler, for work with no queue at all.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO GUESS AT. Several widely used job systems have no single
 * call every run passes through, or invoke the handler in a child process this
 * kit is not inside. Those are listed as blind spots rather than quietly
 * skipped: the count travels with the reading, so a project running everything
 * through one of them shows "cannot tell" instead of a confident, wrong "no
 * background work". Being visibly blind is the whole point — the failure this
 * meter exists to prevent is an empty dashboard read as a healthy one.
 *
 * CRASH SAFETY. Every wrapper calls the host's original function and returns
 * its result untouched, and every line of measurement sits inside its own
 * try/catch. If anything in here throws, the customer's job still runs.

/**
 * Job systems this kit knows how to watch: the package, and the module-cache
 * entries that prove the host already loaded it.
 *
 * SEVERAL FILES PER SYSTEM, because a library's own layout changes between
 * major versions and a single hard-coded path is a meter that quietly dies on
 * upgrade day. Every candidate below is a real published entry point.
 *
 * AND THE LIMIT THAT MATTERS MOST. Everything here reads the CommonJS module
 * registry, which is the only registry of loaded modules Node exposes. What
 * decides whether a library is in it is not how the library was PUBLISHED but
 * how the app REACHED it:
 *
 *   • An app that reaches a library with `require()` puts it there, and it is
 *     watched. On a recent Node that now includes libraries published as ESM
 *     only, because `require()` of an ESM module is supported and lands it in
 *     the same registry as everything else. Several of the queue libraries
 *     here are in exactly that position.
 *
 *   • An app that reaches it with `import` does not. The module namespace is
 *     frozen and there is no registry to look it up in. That is not a bug to
 *     be worked around: reaching into it would mean installing a loader hook
 *     and changing how the customer's whole program resolves modules, in order
 *     to measure it.
 *
 * So the same library can be watched in one project and invisible in the next.
 * The honest half is that {@link armJobSystems} still NOTICES an unreachable
 * one wherever the package left crumbs in the registry — its package.json, its
 * CommonJS dependencies — and counts it as a visible blind spot, so the
 * developer is told to mark those jobs by hand rather than shown a confident
 * zero. Where even the crumbs are absent, nothing is claimed either way: the
 * project simply has no automatic attachment, and its jobs are whatever it
 * marked by hand.
