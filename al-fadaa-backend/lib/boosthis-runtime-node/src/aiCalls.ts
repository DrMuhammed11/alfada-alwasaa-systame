/* ─── Boosthis: AI-call meter (Node) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every app these builders produce calls an AI provider, and
 * that call is usually the slowest and by far the most expensive thing in the
 * request. Until now the kit saw "an outbound call took 8.2 seconds" and
 * nothing else — outbound calls are deliberately reduced to counts and
 * durations, and the destination never leaves the process — so the one part of
 * an AI-built app a developer most needs to understand was the one part we
 * said nothing about.
 *
 * Streaming made it worse. When an answer is streamed, total duration is close
 * to meaningless: what matters is how long before the first words appeared and
 * whether the stream stalled halfway. Nothing measured either.
 *
 * WHERE IT WATCHES, AND WHY THERE. Global `fetch`. Every modern provider SDK
 * (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq, the Vercel AI SDK …) issues
 * through it, and it is the only observation point in Node that can see the
 * REPLY — the outbound diagnostics channel the other meters use delivers
 * request creation, response HEADERS and errors, but never a body, and the
 * token counts live in the body. A client that does not go through global
 * fetch (axios, node-fetch v2, got) is counted as a blind spot rather than
 * quietly reported as an app with no AI calls.
 *
 * WHAT NEVER HAPPENS HERE:
 *   • No prompt and no answer leaves. Reading of the reply is confined to
 *     `aiUsage.ts`, which can only return numbers; a streamed answer's content
 *     deltas are not even handed to a JSON parser.
 *   • No address leaves. A destination becomes a NUMBER from the maintained
 *     provider list (`aiProviders.ts`) or it is not an AI call at all. A call
 *     that cannot be classified stays ordinary outbound traffic — never a
 *     guess.
 *   • The host's own call is never changed. The wrapper passes its arguments
 *     through untouched, returns the provider's own Response object, and every
 *     observation is individually guarded so a failure in here cannot reach
 *     the app. For a destination that is not a known provider the wrapper is a
 *     single classification and a straight call through.
 *   • Nothing is buffered on the app's behalf. The reply is observed as the
 *     app itself reads it; an app that never reads a body costs no memory.
 *
 * PROMPT IDENTITY, AND WHY IT IS SAFE. "The same prompt sent repeatedly" is
 * one of the fixes this reading is here to name, and repetition is only
 * judgeable if two calls can be told apart. The request body is therefore
 * folded into a 32-bit in-process hash on the stack and dropped — exactly what
 * the database meter already does with SQL text and its arguments. The text is
 * never stored, never logged and NEVER leaves this process; only the count of
 * how many times one identity recurred inside one request is reported.
 *
 * ADDITIVE. Three axes (`aiCalls`, `aiSpend`, `aiHeadroom`), none of which
 * touches the composite Speed score, and none of which moves an existing
 * reading. An AI call is claimed by this meter INSTEAD of the repeated-work
 * meter: two different prompts to one provider endpoint share a method, an
 * origin and a path, so the older meter had to call them a repeat. Here they
 * are told apart properly.
 *
 * HONEST WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY. An app that calls no AI provider
 * uploads NO axis at all, which every surface reads as "cannot tell" — never a
 * row of zeros. Runtimes without this reading do the same.
