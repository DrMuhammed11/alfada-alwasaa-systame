/* ─── Boosthis: a process with no web server is still a project ────────────
 *
 * Everything this kit offers used to hang off a web server. `boosthis()` is
 * middleware, so it needs a framework; the kit's own status page is served on
 * the app's port, so it needs a port; and the whole shape of the thing assumed
 * a request would eventually arrive.
 *
 * A queue consumer has none of that. It listens on nothing, it answers nobody,
 * and it can run for months doing the most important work in the system. Until
 * now such a process could not be measured at all — and worse, a customer who
 * split their back end into "the web app" and "the workers" saw only half of
 * it and had no way to tell that the other half was missing rather than idle.
 *
 * `boosthisWorker()` is that half. It is the whole kit minus the middleware:
 *
 *   • IDENTITY — the same install id and project key as any other install, so
 *     a worker is a project in its own right on the dashboard, not an
 *     appendage of the web app. Two processes sharing one project key are two
 *     installs of one project, which is exactly what they are.
 *   • REGISTRATION — the ordinary handshake. It was never request-driven;
 *     nothing had to change.
 *   • UPLOADING — the ordinary timer-driven mirror, which likewise never
 *     needed a request. What DID need saying is that a worker has no reason to
 *     ever call the middleware, so the meters that arm at the request boundary
 *     are armed here instead.
 *   • THE KIT'S OWN STATUS SURFACE — the part that genuinely could not work.
 *     With no port there is nothing to serve a page on, so the same facts the
 *     page shows are rendered as TEXT and printed. A developer who cannot see
 *     their worker on the dashboard needs the same answers as everyone else,
 *     and "open the status page" is not one of them here.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never starts, schedules or triggers any work. It
 * does not create a queue, connect to Redis, or hold the process open: every
 * timer it owns is unreferenced, so a worker that finishes its work still
 * exits when it always did.
