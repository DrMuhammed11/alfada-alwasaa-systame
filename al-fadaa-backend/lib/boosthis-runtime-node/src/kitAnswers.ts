/** The ONE place that decides what a kit-owned read answers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The kit is reachable through three different doors: the Express middleware
 * (`app.use(boosthis())`), the Express route mount (`mount(app)`), and — since
 * the framework-free attach — the raw Node request boundary, which is the only
 * door a Fastify / Hono / Next.js / NestJS / plain-`http` app has.
 *
 * Three doors used to mean three copies of "what does /panel return, and who
 * is allowed to read it". They had already drifted: the middleware withheld
 * the meters behind a kill-switch lock and the mounted route did not, so the
 * SAME app answered differently depending on which door a request happened to
 * reach first. An adapter that merely watches traffic does not get to invent
 * its own answers — it dispatches to this module, above its instrumentation,
 * and writes whatever comes back in the shape its host expects.
 *
 * So: this module decides the STATUS, the BODY and the GATE. It never touches
 * a response object — writing is the adapter's job, because an Express
 * response and a bare `http.ServerResponse` are written differently.
