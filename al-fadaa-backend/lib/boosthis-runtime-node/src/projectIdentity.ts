/** WHICH PROJECT this kit reports to, in the developer's own words.
 *
 * WHY this exists: every surface a developer could open inside their own app —
 * the floating panel, the /_boosthis page, the status page — named a masked key
 * tail, an install id and an app name, and NEVER the project name they typed on
 * their dashboard. Meanwhile the AI connection had been naming the project
 * everywhere for weeks. The same project told two different stories depending
 * on which window you were looking at, and a developer holding two projects in
 * one codebase could not tell from inside the app which one they were feeding.
 *
 * A kit cannot work the name out on its own: it holds a key, not a name. So the
 * server sends it back on the registration reply and this module keeps it.
 *
 * TWO rules that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  1. THE NAME IS UNTRUSTED DISPLAY DATA. It is the one developer-authored
 *     string a kit draws from the wire (everything else the panel renders is a
 *     literal in the kit's own source). The server screens and caps it at mint
 *     time; this module screens it AGAIN — control characters out, whitespace
 *     collapsed, hard length cap — and every renderer sets it as TEXT, never as
 *     markup.
 *
 *  2. THE FALLBACK WORDING IS OURS, NOT THE SERVER'S. An unnamed project sends
 *     a code and no name; a server that is too old to know about any of this
 *     sends neither. Both cases are answered by literals below, so no server
 *     prose is ever drawn inside a customer's app.

//
// The SAME two rules apply, with one addition:
//
//  1. THE WORDING IS UNTRUSTED DISPLAY DATA — the developer's own words,
//     screened by the server, screened again here, rendered as text.
//  2. THE STANDING IS A CLOSED TOKEN, never a sentence. The words for
//     "watched" and "remembered only" are literals in the page's own source,
//     held byte-equal to the server's by a test, so no server prose is drawn
//     inside a customer's app.
//  3. NO VERDICT TRAVELS. Whether a watched promise is currently broken moves
//     between one registration and the next, and this page would go on
//     showing the answer from process start. The page says where each promise
//     stands with Boosthis; the dashboard says how it is doing.
