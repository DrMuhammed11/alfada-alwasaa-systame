/** Privacy-safe perf-snapshot mirror for the Node runtime.
 *
 * Node parity for RN's `perfSnapshotUpload.ts`. It captures the whole live
 * meter page as ONE small, allowlisted JSON object and ships it to
 * `POST /api/snapshots` (the same ingest RN uses) so the developer's OWN AI can
 * read the live picture back over the hosted MCP live-read tools + `GET
 * /api/snapshot`. No new server surface is added — the payload maps into the
 * existing allowlisted snapshot fields (`capturedAt`, `runtimeVersion`,
 * `platform`, `startedAt`, `totalEvents`, `rows`, `crossCutting`, `axes`) so it
 * passes the server's `sanitizeSnapshotLabels` + PII guard unchanged.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the snapshot carries only code-defined route labels + numeric
 * timings/counts/rating buckets — never user values, source, or PII. Route-row
 * keys and cross-cutting finding names are still filtered through the PII guard
 * (in telemetry.ts `transmitSnapshot`) before upload, and the whole payload
 * clears `assertNoPII`. Uploading is OFF by default in issues-only mode and is
 * enabled only by the developer's explicit `shareMeterWithAI` opt-in or the
 * server directive once they connect an AI from the web dashboard — matching
 * RN's privacy-by-default contract.
