/**
 * Scheduled jobs — what the app tells Boosthis about its own background work.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything else the kit measures happens while somebody is
 * waiting: a request, a screen, a call out to another service. The work that
 * runs when nobody is looking — a nightly billing run, a queue drain, a
 * reindex — was invisible. An app had no way to say "that ran", so Boosthis had
 * no way to notice that it stopped. A scheduled job that quietly dies is one of
 * the commonest ways a working app stops doing its job.
 *
 * WHAT IS REPORTED, AND NOTHING ELSE. Four facts per run: the job's own name,
 * how long ago it finished, how long it took, and whether it succeeded. There
 * is no field for arguments, payload, input, output or error detail — not here,
 * not on the wire, and nowhere on the server to put them. A job's contents are
 * the customer's business.
 *
 * TIME IS RELATIVE ON PURPOSE. A run reports `finishedAgoMs`, an age, never a
 * wall-clock time. A machine whose clock is a month out can therefore never
 * file a run under the wrong day or make a stale job look fresh.
 *
 * THE KIT IS A GUEST. `reportJobRun` and `trackJob` never throw, never wait on
 * the network, and never change what the host's own code does. `trackJob`
 * re-raises the host's error untouched after recording the failure: the app's
 * error handling is the app's, and a reporting failure must never surface as an
 * application failure. Nothing here can crash, slow or alter the host.
