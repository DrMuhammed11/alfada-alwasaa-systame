/** Attach to ANY Node server — Next.js, Fastify, Hono, NestJS, plain `http`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * For its whole life this kit had exactly one way in: `app.use(boosthis())`,
 * the Express middleware shape. Apps built with an AI assistant very often
 * come out as something else, and for those the installing AI had to invent
 * the wiring. What it usually invented registered the project and drew the
 * badge — and measured nothing, forever. The customer saw a panel and believed
 * they were watched.
 *
 * `attach()` removes the guesswork. It watches the ONE boundary every Node
 * server shares: the `request` event a `http.Server` (or `https.Server`)
 * raises for each request, before any framework's router sees it. Whatever
 * runs above that boundary — a Next.js server, a Fastify instance, a Hono
 * handler, a Nest application, a bare listener — is timed the same way, with
 * no framework-specific glue anywhere.
 *
 * THE TWO ARRIVE TOGETHER, OR NEITHER DOES
 *
 * The kit's own page, badge poll and status page are served from THIS SAME
 * patch, above the instrumentation. That is not a convenience: it is the
 * structural answer to the failure this task exists to kill. A project cannot
 * end up with a visible panel and permanently empty readings, because the code
 * that draws the panel is the code that takes the readings. If the patch
 * cannot go on, there is no panel either — and the kit says so out loud, at
 * startup and on the status page.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *
 * Express apps are untouched: they never call this, and the middleware they do
 * call behaves exactly as it always has. Nothing here measures anything new —
 * every reading comes from the same middleware, reached through a different
 * door.

 * way registered, appeared on its owner's dashboard, and then never timed a
 * single request — the exact "connected but never measured" state, caused by us
 * rather than by anything about their app. It reached a real customer's project.
 *
 * The refusal was a guess about a capability, and the capability is one we can
 * simply ASK FOR: Bun implements `node:http`, its `Server.prototype.emit` takes
 * the same patch Node's does, and a patched Bun server really does see its
 * `request` events (scripts/live-proofs/bun-server-kit proves it against a
 * running server rather than asserting it here). So Bun now goes down the
 * ordinary path, and if the patch does not take — on Bun or on Node — the
 * read-back in `patchPrototype` produces `server-dispatch-locked`, which is a
 * MEASURED refusal rather than an assumed one.
 *
 * Deno stays refused, in its OWN words and for its own reason (`deno-runtime`,
 * never a shared "some other runtime" bucket — sharing one is what let Bun be
 * refused by a sentence written about Deno). Its `node:http` compatibility is a
 * different and much thinner story, no proof rig runs a real Deno app, an
 * isolate host is what the edge kit is for, and refusing something we have not
 * proved is the honest direction to be wrong in. The moment a live Deno proof
 * exists, this line goes the way Bun's did.
