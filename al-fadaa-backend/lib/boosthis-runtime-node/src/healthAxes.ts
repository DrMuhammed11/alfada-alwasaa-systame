/** Additive dashboard meters derived from live, privacy-safe perf state.
 *
 * Two read-only gauges shown on the Node dashboard:
 *   - Code Health — how much rule pressure the running app is under right now
 *     (poor/needs-work routes, budget regressions, distinct live finding kinds).
 *   - Resilience  — how stable latency is under load (tail blowup p99/p50,
 *     poor-sample rate, and budget-regression pressure).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: these axes are ADDITIVE. They are computed from the same
 * in-process summary + budget state the dashboard already shows, and they
 * NEVER feed the composite Speed score (TTFF/TTI/FID) — see thresholds.ts.
 * They carry only counts, ratios, scores, and rating buckets; no route names,
 * timings, source, or values are added to any transmit path. Mirrored by
 * `lib/boosthis-py/boosthis/health_axes.py` (keep the two in sync).
