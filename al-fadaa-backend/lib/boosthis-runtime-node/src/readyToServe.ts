/** When this app became ready to serve — the boundary a cold start is measured to.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The cold-start reading used to end at OUR enable call: process start → the
 * moment the host called `enableTelemetry()`. Everything the app did after that
 * — building a pool, warming a cache, running migrations, binding the port —
 * fell outside the interval, and the number was rated anyway. A service with a
 * deliberate 1.5-second delay planted after the enable call reported 376 ms and
 * was rated *good*. The reading was correct about an interval nobody asked
 * about, under a name that promises the one they did.
 *
 * A Node process can watch the moment that matters without asking the developer
 * for anything: every server in this runtime — Express, Fastify, Hono, Nest,
 * Next, a bare `http.createServer`, an `https` or `http2` server — reaches the
 * network through `net.Server.prototype.listen`, and raises `listening` when the
 * socket is actually accepting connections. That is the one boundary they all
 * share, the same reasoning `serverAttach.ts` uses for the `request` event.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *
 * Replaces that one prototype method with a wrapper that arms a single
 * `once("listening")` listener per server and then calls straight through. The
 * FIRST such event freezes the process age; nothing is ever re-read. The
 * wrapper adds one function call to a call each server makes once in its life.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 * It never decides anything about a request, never delays a bind, and never
 * lets a failure of its own reach the host: a frozen prototype, a runtime with
 * no `node:net`, or a throw anywhere inside simply leaves the mark unset. An
 * unset mark is not a zero and not a guess — `runtimeVitals` then reports the
 * interval it CAN see (process start → kit switched on) as an explicitly
 * partial, unrated reading. See docs/cold-start-boundary-contract.md.
