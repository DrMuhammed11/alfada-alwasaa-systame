/* ─── Boosthis: live cross-cutting detectors (Node) ──────────────────────
 *
 * Two always-on, observe-only detectors that surface performance anti-patterns
 * the per-route timer cannot see, emitted as ordinary {@link CrossCuttingFinding}s
 * so they ride the EXISTING candidate-rule + snapshot pipeline (no new server
 * route, no new table):
 *
 *   • retry-storm — the same outbound host is hammered many times in a short
 *     window with no backoff (a classic thundering-herd / missing-retry-budget
 *     bug). Fed automatically from undici/global-`fetch` via `diagnostics_channel`
 *     ("undici:request:create") and/or explicitly via {@link recordOutboundAttempt}.
 *
 *   • idle-burn — the event loop keeps burning CPU while NO request is in
 *     flight (a stranded timer / busy-poll leak). Measured only at request
 *     boundaries via `performance.eventLoopUtilization()` — there is NO
 *     background poller (Boosthis's own rule book forbids idle spinners), so
 *     the idle-burn detector never itself burns idle.
 *
 * PRIVACY (identical to every other finding):
 *   - The `name` we keep is a bare outbound HOSTNAME (retry-storm) or a fixed
 *     non-route label (idle-burn). It never carries a path, query, userinfo, or
 *     port, and it is PII-filtered again in telemetry.ts before any upload.
 *   - `signatureFor` drops `name` entirely, so the candidate-rule fingerprint is
 *     kind + severity bucket + count bucket only — never a host, value, or code.
 *   - `p95`/`count` are honest measurements (burst span in ms + attempt count;
 *     loop-active ms during an idle window + occurrence count), NOT synthetic
 *     severity numbers, so the meter page never shows a fabricated latency.
 *   - Everything is in-memory only. Nothing leaves the process here — findings
 *     only travel through the already-gated snapshot/candidate pipeline, which
 *     is off for unregistered installs and silenced entirely by
 *     `BOOSTHIS_DISABLED`.
 *
 * Node↔Python parity: the wire OUTPUT (finding kind + field shape) is
 * byte-identical to `lib/boosthis-py/boosthis/live_detectors.py`; only the
 * runtime-specific plumbing to FEED the detectors differs (diagnostics_channel
 * + ELU here, explicit API + process_time there), exactly as the runtimes
 * already differ elsewhere.

/**
 * FORWARD THIS HOP'S TRACE TO THE NEXT SERVICE.
 *
 * The kit is already standing inside the host's outgoing call to measure it.
 * Attaching the trace headers here is what makes a two-service install produce
 * ONE trace instead of two, with nothing wired by hand at any call site.
 *
 * Four refusals, in the order they are cheapest to decide:
 *
 *   1. A client that gives us no way to add a header. Nothing to do.
 *   2. Boosthis's own upload endpoint. Our flushes are not the customer's next
 *      hop, and tagging them would put a customer's trace id on our own wire
 *      for no reason at all.
 *   3. A destination the customer's configuration does not permit — which, by
 *      default, is every destination that could be an outside company. See
 *      `tracePropagation.ts` for the rule and why the default is what it is,
 *      and `destinationHostOf` below for WHICH host that rule is asked about.
 *      It is not always the one the socket is open to.
 *   4. No trace to forward: this call was not made inside a request the
 *      middleware handled, so there is no hop for the next service to be a
 *      child of. A minted one would name a caller that does not exist.
 *
 * And one deference: a host who set ANY of the three headers themselves keeps
 * all three. They may be forwarding a trace from somewhere the kit cannot see,
 * and undici's `addHeader` APPENDS rather than replaces, so a second copy would
 * reach the destination as a two-value header rather than a correction.
 *
 * CANNOT BREAK THE CALL, AND CANNOT HALF-CHANGE IT. Every value is built and
 * checked BEFORE the first one is attached, so the loop runs only over
 * validated strings — but `addHeader` is the host object's own method and
 * pre-validation makes a throw unlikely, not impossible. A throw on the second
 * write would otherwise put the request on the wire carrying part of the set,
 * so the accumulated header block is snapshotted first and put back if the
 * loop does not finish. Whatever happens, the request that is sent is either
 * exactly what the host built or exactly that plus the whole set, and nothing
 * surfaces: at worst the trace stops at this service, as it always used to.
 */
/** WHERE THIS REQUEST IS REALLY GOING, as the propagation rule must judge it.
 *
 * `origin` is the host the CONNECTION is open to, and through a plain-HTTP
 * forward proxy that is the proxy — usually loopback, usually permitted —
 * while the request itself is on its way to a company nothing has judged.
 * undici puts the real recipient in `path`, as an absolute-form request
 * target (`http://api.provider.com/pay` rather than `/pay`), and that is the
 * only place on the request where it appears. Judging `origin` alone let the
 * default rule pass a header to exactly the destination it exists to refuse.
 *
 * A CONNECT tunnel needs nothing extra here: undici opens the tunnel beneath a
 * Client whose origin IS the far-side service, so `origin` already names the
 * recipient. Python's stdlib client differs — its connection keeps the proxy
 * as its host for the tunnel's whole life — which is why `_destination_host`
 * over there has a third case this one does not need.
 *
 * Both readings go through `hostOf`, which for a string beginning `http://`
 * or `https://` uses the URL parser. That matters for IPv6: a hand-rolled
 * "drop the port by splitting on the colon" turns `2001:4860:4860::8888` into
 * the single-label name `2001`, and single-label names are internal by
 * default — one helper would open every public IPv6 address there is.
 *
 * Never throws. A target it cannot read is `""`, which attaches nothing.
