/* ─── Boosthis: database-work meter (Node) ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A project on Express + Postgres could already see how long
 * each request took, and nothing told it how much of that time was spent
 * WAITING ON THE DATABASE — or that one request ran the same statement twenty
 * times. The rule book has always told developers to fix both (`n-plus-one-
 * orm-node`, `unbounded-result-set`, `db-write-in-loop`); no reading ever
 * found them, because the kit only watched calls a developer had wrapped by
 * hand plus outbound HTTP. A driver talking Postgres over its own socket was
 * completely invisible.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF DATABASE, AND THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY.
 *
 *  1. A TRADITIONAL DRIVER (`pg`) opens its own connection and never touches
 *     the HTTP stack, so nothing here saw it at all. This module watches its
 *     round-trip layer — `Client.prototype.query` — which is the single point
 *     every plain query AND every ORM query (Drizzle, Knex, Sequelize,
 *     TypeORM) passes through, because they all issue through a `pg` client.
 *     `Pool.query` is deliberately NOT patched: it delegates to a client, so
 *     patching both would count every pooled query twice.
 *
 *  2. A HOSTED DATABASE REACHED OVER THE WEB (Supabase, Firebase, Neon's HTTP
 *     driver, Turso, PlanetScale, Prisma Accelerate …) rides the same undici
 *     observation point the outbound-call meter already uses — but it arrived
 *     there as a destination name and looked exactly like any other API call.
 *     {@link isHostedDatabaseCall} classifies it as database work instead, so
 *     the reading covers a project that mixes both (very common in AI-built
 *     apps) rather than silently reporting on half of it.
 *
 * NEVER LOADS A CLIENT THE HOST DID NOT CHOOSE. A library is observed only if
 * the app ALREADY loaded it: the check is a lookup in the CommonJS module
 * cache, and the module object is taken FROM that cache. This kit never
 * imports a database driver, never resolves one into existence, and an app
 * with no Postgres client is untouched.
 *
 * PRIVACY — the whole point of counting in here. A statement's SHAPE plus its
 * ARGUMENTS are a visible input, which is exactly what makes repetition
 * judgeable; both are folded into a 32-bit in-process hash on the stack and
 * dropped. No SQL text, no parameter value, no table or column name, no
 * database host and no connection string is stored, logged, or uploaded. Only
 * counts, durations and shares ever leave — the same numbers-only contract the
 * repeated-work meter already ships under.
 *
 * HONEST WHEN BLIND. A client this kit cannot watch must never read as an app
 * with no database work. {@link unwatchedDbClientCount} counts the database
 * libraries this process loaded that have no safe round-trip layer to observe
 * (Prisma's queries run inside a Rust engine; postgres.js, mysql2, mongodb and
 * the SQLite bindings have no single JS funnel yet), and that count ships
 * beside the reading so the tile can say "cannot tell" instead of "none".
 * A kit that watched nothing at all reports NO axis, which the dashboard reads
 * as "cannot tell" — never a confident zero.
 *
 * ADDITIVE. This never touches the composite Speed score, and it never files
 * into the repeated-work meter: database repetition is reported here, HTTP and
 * hand-wrapped repetition stays there, and neither reading moves because the
 * other shipped.
 *
 * LATER WORK — the remaining server kits. Node first. Go, Java, Python, PHP,
 * .NET, Ruby, Rust and Elixir each need their own driver funnel located before
 * this can be honest there; until then they simply do not upload the axis,
 * which reads as "cannot tell". The phone and browser kits make no database
 * calls of this shape and are out of scope forever.
