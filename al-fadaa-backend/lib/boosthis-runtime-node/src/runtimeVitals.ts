/* ─── Boosthis: runtime-vitals axes (Node) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three more honest, display-only backend meters, added so the Node/Python/Go/
 * Java dashboards expose a comparable set of gauges to the RN kit (the owner's
 * request: "RN shows many meters, the others show few"). Each is derived from
 * cheap, always-available runtime reads — NO background poller (Boosthis's own
 * rule book forbids idle spinners), NO new collection, NO PII:
 *
 *   - Memory Stability — heap-growth trend (a leak/steady-climb signal). The
 *     least-squares slope of heap-used (MB) over wall-clock minutes, sampled at
 *     request boundaries. Flat/shrinking = healthy; a sustained climb = poor.
 *   - GC Pressure     — the share of wall time this process has spent paused in
 *     garbage collection (`PerformanceObserver('gc')`). Low = healthy.
 *   - Reliability     — the request error rate (HTTP 5xx / total) observed by the
 *     middleware, with throughput reported in the caption. Low errors = healthy.
 *
 * PARITY: keys, labels, rating bands, and the wire shape are the cross-runtime
 * standard — Python/Go/Java mirror them byte-for-byte. The metric→score
 * thresholds are necessarily per-runtime (a "healthy" GC share on the V8 heap is
 * not the same number as on the Go or JVM collectors), exactly as `eventLoopLag`
 * uses axis-specific bands rather than the shared TTI thresholds.
 *
 * INVARIANT: these axes are ADDITIVE and display-only. They never feed the
 * composite Speed score (TTFF/TTI/FID) — see thresholds.ts. They carry only
 * numbers, a fixed rating bucket, and a machine-built caption (numbers + fixed
 * vocabulary, never a route name/value/source). Each rides inside the existing
 * snapshot upload and clears the same PII guard as every other field.
 *
 * HONESTY: an axis is OMITTED (the server renders it "pending") until it has
 * enough data to mean something — never a 100 or 0 fabricated from one request
 * or a just-booted process. "Concurrency" is deliberately NOT shipped as a
 * scored axis: raw in-flight/thread counts have no honest good/bad rating
 * without a capacity or SLO reference, and Boosthis never fabricates a score.
