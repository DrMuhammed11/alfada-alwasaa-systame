/* ─── Boosthis: outbound-network sampler (Node) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Aggregates the OUTBOUND calls the app makes into the label-free counts +
 * durations the `network` meter axis scores (see meterAxes.ts computeNetworkScore).
 * It is FED from the SAME undici/global-`fetch` `diagnostics_channel`
 * observation point that already drives the retry-storm detector in
 * liveDetectors.ts — there is NO second interception layer. liveDetectors owns
 * the subscription and calls the lifecycle hooks here (attempt start / complete
 * / error), and any outbound client the runtime cannot auto-observe can call
 * `recordOutboundAttempt` explicitly, exactly as the retry-storm detector does.
 *
 * Outcome buckets mirror the RN network sampler:
 *   • completed — the call finished (with any HTTP status; a 500 is a LOUD,
 *     completed response, not a silent stall).
 *   • failed    — the call errored (undici emitted an error).
 *   • timeout   — the call errored with a timeout-class error.
 *   • stall     — the call NEVER completed within the kit's existing stall
 *     horizon (NETWORK_STALL_MS): the silent-drop class the axis exists for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COUNTS, AND WHAT THE RETRY-STORM DETECTOR COUNTS. The two are fed
 * from one observation point but they do not measure the same thing, so their
 * attempt counts are not interchangeable:
 *   • This sampler counts attempts it can TIME — one per `recordAttemptStart`,
 *     i.e. one per auto-observed undici request. Every start is counted, even
 *     when the in-flight table is full, so the rate stays honest; the outcome
 *     buckets only advance when an attempt RESOLVES, so `attemptCount` is
 *     >= completed+failed+timeout+stall while calls are still in flight.
 *   • The retry-storm detector (liveDetectors.ts) counts attempts per TARGET
 *     HOST over a rolling window. It also accepts attempts an app reports by
 *     hand for clients the kit cannot observe; those never reach this sampler,
 *     because a hand-reported attempt carries no end signal to time it against.
 *     And it drops attempts past its host cap, which this sampler does not.
 * On the auto-observed path the two agree attempt-for-attempt — including a
 * burst of retries — and outboundRetryAccounting.test.ts holds them to it.
 * Everywhere else the storm detector sees MORE attempts, never fewer.
 *
 * WHAT NEITHER OF THEM COUNTS is a call to Boosthis's own upload endpoint.
 * Registrations, check-ins and snapshot flushes ride the same global `fetch`
 * the observer watches, and they are not the app's outbound traffic: the
 * observer drops them at the top of every callback, before any counter here
 * runs. This sampler therefore measures only calls the app made itself, which
 * is what lets an app with no outbound dependencies report none — and what
 * keeps a slow or refusing Boosthis from degrading a customer's
 * outbound-reliability reading.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOT COUNTED ON TRUST. Every function here that STARTS an attempt
 * or a connection takes an `AppTraffic` pass, which only `ownTraffic.ts` can
 * mint and only for a destination it could read and that is not ours. The
 * screen used to be a property of this module's ONE caller: true today, and
 * silently false the day a second observation point is wired in — a plain
 * `http.ClientRequest` patch, another client library — which would have fed
 * our own traffic straight into the app's meters with nothing refusing it and
 * no test failing. A new caller that has not asked the question now fails to
 * compile; one that forces its way past the types is refused here at runtime
 * and counted as a refusal (see `_networkSamplerInternals.unattributedRefused`)
 * rather than dropped in silence.
 *
 * PRIVACY: only durations (ms) and outcome counts ever reach this module — no
 * host, URL, path, header, status line, or any request detail. THE PASS IS NOT
 * AN EXCEPTION TO THAT: it carries no host and no request, only the verdict
 * "somebody asked, and this is the app's". The question is answered on the
 * caller's side of the boundary; only the answer crosses it. Everything is
 * in-memory only and bounded (a fixed-size ring of recent durations). A no-op
 * under the kill-switch.
