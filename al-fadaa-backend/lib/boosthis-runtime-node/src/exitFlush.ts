/**
 * Getting the last measurements out before the process goes.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS ENDS
 * ------------------
 *
 * A back end that boots, does a little work and exits — a worker, a scheduled
 * script, a container being recycled — used to upload NOTHING at all, however
 * much it measured.
 *
 * Every measured request is queued in `reporting.ts` and drained on a throttled
 * tick whose timer is `unref`'d, exactly so the kit can never hold a host
 * process open. That is the right call and it stays: a meter that keeps
 * somebody's program alive has changed what their program does. But it has a
 * consequence nobody had answered — when the event loop empties, the process
 * leaves and the queue leaves with it. Registration, by contrast, goes out
 * immediately. So the install appears on the dashboard, checks in, and reads
 * "never measured", for ever, with nothing anywhere saying why.
 *
 * The span buffer, the meter page and the job-run queue lose their contents the
 * same way, for the same reason.
 *
 * WHAT CLOSES A PROCESS, AND WHAT WE DO ABOUT EACH
 * ------------------
 *
 * `beforeExit` — the ordinary case: the event loop has emptied and Node is
 * about to leave. Async work started here KEEPS THE PROCESS ALIVE until it
 * settles, which is what makes it the right hook: an HTTP upload can actually
 * finish. It does not fire on an explicit `process.exit()`, on an uncaught
 * exception, or on a signal, and nothing here pretends otherwise.
 *
 * `SIGTERM` — a container being recycled, `docker stop`, a process manager
 * cycling a worker. Node's default disposition kills the process outright and
 * `beforeExit` never fires, which is the exact shape of the installs that
 * started this. So we take the signal — but ONLY when the host has not taken
 * it, and having taken it we **own the whole exit**: flush under a short
 * budget, drop our listener, and re-send the signal so the process dies exactly
 * as it would have, with the same status. A listener that flushes and then
 * simply returns would have turned SIGTERM into a signal this app IGNORES,
 * which is a far worse bug than the one being fixed. A second signal while we
 * are flushing means *go now* and takes the same route immediately.
 *
 * `exit` — the last synchronous moment, reached by every ending above AND by
 * an explicit `process.exit()`. Nothing async can run there, so no queue is
 * flushed from it; it exists only to close the kit's run record, which is one
 * synchronous write. Without it a service that ends itself on purpose looks,
 * to the next launch, exactly like one that was killed.
 *
 * `SIGINT` is deliberately left alone. Node's default for it also terminates,
 * but it is the interactive Ctrl-C of somebody at a terminal who wants their
 * prompt back, and adding up to two seconds to that is a worse trade than the
 * measurements are worth. `process.exit()`, `SIGKILL` and a hard crash cannot
 * be helped from inside the process, and nothing here claims they can.
 *
 * RULES THIS MODULE KEEPS
 * ------------------
 *
 * - **Never change what the host does.** We take a signal only when nobody is
 *   listening for it, and we always re-send it. We add no `ref`'d handle, so a
 *   process that would have exited still exits.
 * - **Bounded.** The whole flush shares one wall-clock budget
 *   ({@link EXIT_FLUSH_BUDGET_MS}). An unreachable server delays a shutdown by
 *   that much and no more.
 * - **Silent.** Nothing here throws — an instrumentation library may not turn a
 *   clean exit into a stack trace.
 * - **Once.** `beforeExit` fires again after the async work it started
 *   settles; without a latch this would be an infinite loop that never lets the
 *   process die.
