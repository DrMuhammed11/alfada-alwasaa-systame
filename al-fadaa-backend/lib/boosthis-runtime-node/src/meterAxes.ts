/* ─── Boosthis Node meter axes — ADDITIVE server-side perf signals ───────
 *
 * Node parity for the React-Native kit's `meterAxes.ts`. These axes ENRICH the
 * dashboard/bubble and the uploaded snapshot WITHOUT touching the composite
 * Speed score (TTFF/TTI/FID, defined in thresholds.ts). Every scorer here
 * mirrors the SAME thresholds, the SAME linearScore/ratingFor bands
 * (good >= 85, needs-work >= 60, else poor; null score => "pending"), and the
 * SAME honesty gates as the canonical RN source, so the same number means the
 * same thing in every language.
 *
 * The axes added here for cross-runtime parity:
 *   • confidence   — how much data backs the numbers (least-sampled scored route).
 *   • baseline     — each route graded against ITS OWN recent history (drift).
 *   • network      — outbound-call stall/timeout rate + p75 latency.
 *   • idle         — CPU burned while zero requests were in flight.
 *   • latencyFloor — the worst completed 10s window's p95 request latency.
 *   • repeatedWork — the same call, made more than once inside one request.
 *   • dbWork       — how much of a request was spent waiting on the database,
 *                    and whether one request ran the same statement repeatedly.
 *
 * PRIVACY: counts, ratios and durations only. No route label, host, URL, or any
 * customer-controllable string ever reaches these functions — route identity is
 * handled upstream via the middleware's sanitized route-label mechanism, and the
 * baseline axis receives only ordered duration arrays (never the route key).

 * the thing it measured. The caller now hands over the route's FROZEN
 * baseline (its first samples after warm-up, kept by the ring module as they
 * arrived) and, separately, samples stamped strictly after that baseline
 * closed. The same rule the learned budget follows, so the panel's Baseline
 * tile and the route's budget cannot give one app two answers — see
 * docs/learned-budget-contract.md.
 *
 * Anomaly ratio = recentMedian / baselineMedian; a route is anomalous only
 * when it is BOTH materially slower (ratio >= good) AND the absolute jump
 * clears BASELINE_MIN_DELTA_MS. Score the WORST eligible ratio (1.2× → 100,

 * issued together and ten calls issued one after another produce an identical
 * reading. This axis is the missing half — how many ROUND-TRIP WAVES a request
 * took, and how much of its database time could not overlap with anything.
 *
 * THE RULE IS DEFINED ONCE, for every kit, in docs/db-round-trip-waves.md: a
 * call opens a wave when nothing else is in flight at its start, and joins the
 * wave already running otherwise. It is computed from TWO TIMESTAMPS PER CALL
 * and nothing else — no statement text, no table name, no column name, no
 * parameter. That is what makes it shippable at all.
 *
 * WHAT IS SCORED. The worst request's wave count, and only that. Good at 2
 * (a request that talks to the database once or twice in sequence is an
 * ordinary request), poor at 10 (the page is a queue of round trips). The
 * single-file SHARE is reported beside it rather than scored: an app that
 * makes one query per request is 100% "single file" and perfectly healthy, so
 * scoring the share alone would mark the simplest app poor.
 *
 * ADDITIVE + DISPLAY-ONLY: never feeds the composite Speed score, and it moves

 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SCORED, ON PURPOSE. Money. A big bill can be exactly right: an
 * app that does real work with a real model is not a broken app. Cost is
 * reported so the developer can see it, never graded. A cold prompt cache is
 * likewise reported as a finding rather than a mark, because an app whose
