/** Which kind of Node server this app runs.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The kit used to be an Express middleware and nothing else, so "what is this
 * customer running?" had one possible answer and nobody had to ask. Now that
 * the kit attaches at the Node request boundary itself, a project can be
 * Next.js, Fastify, Hono, NestJS or a plain `http` server — and we cannot see
 * any of that from the dashboard unless the kit says so.
 *
 * The label is DIAGNOSTIC, not a capability: nothing the kit does branches on
 * it. It exists so that a developer opening their project page sees the kit
 * naming their own stack back to them (a wrong name is a visible sign that
 * something is not what we think it is), and so we can see how customers are
 * really building instead of guessing.
 *
 * HONESTY RULES
 *   - Positive evidence only. A framework is named when it is actually loaded
 *     in this process, or when the app's own request listener carries its
 *     marks — never because a package.json mentions it.
 *   - `node-http` means "no framework we know of is in this process", which is
 *     what a plain `http.createServer` app looks like from in here. A
 *     framework we have never heard of looks the same; that is stated in the
 *     wording rather than papered over.
 *   - `unknown` is a real answer, kept for the case where we could not look at
 *     all. It is never a placeholder for "probably plain Node".
