 * that stopped — a declaration that never left the process could not raise an
 * alert and made the kit and the dashboard answer differently about the same
 * job. None of these ever start or schedule anything.

 * REMEMBERED ONLY and stays that way until a human confirms the interpretation
 * on the project page, exactly like an AI-written one — and a promise that
 * page has since edited or confirmed is never overwritten by this call. There
