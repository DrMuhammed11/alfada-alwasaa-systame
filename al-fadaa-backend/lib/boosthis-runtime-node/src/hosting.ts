/**
 * WHERE THIS PROJECT RUNS — recognition, not guesswork.
 *
 * Every hosting platform publishes something about itself to the code running
 * on it, and most publish a region and an environment with it. This module
 * reads only those declarations and turns them into three words from three
 * fixed lists.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * ----------------------------------
 *   - It reads no other configuration and sends none. The markers below are
 *     the only variables it looks at, and it sends the WORD it recognised,
 *     never the value it read. Nothing free-form leaves the process.
 *   - It never guesses a host from a similar one. Something unfamiliar
 *     declaring itself answers "unrecognised", which is a real answer, and an
 *     honest one.
 *   - It never reads an environment as "production" on a hunch. A preview's
 *     numbers being mistaken for the real app's is precisely what this exists
 *     to prevent, so a host that declares nothing answers "unknown".
 *
 * KEEP IN LOCKSTEP with the closed lists in
 * artifacts/api-server/src/lib/hostingPlatforms.ts — the server checks every
 * arriving word against them and stores anything it does not hold as
 * "unrecognised". A guard test on the server side fails if the two drift.
