/** Upstream cache verdict — what the services THIS APP CALLS said.
 *
 * Every major hosting platform and CDN states, in the reply itself, whether it
 * served that reply from its own cache or fetched it fresh. Nobody looks. This
 * module reads that one verdict off the replies the app's OWN outbound calls
 * receive (observed at the existing undici headers boundary — no new hook, no
 * new traffic) and keeps four counters.
 *
 * WHOSE VERDICT THIS IS — AND WHOSE IT IS NOT
 * -------------------------------------------
 * These verdicts belong to the app's DEPENDENCIES, never to the hosting this
 * project chose. A server never sees its own platform's verdict: the CDN
 * stamps that on the way out, after this process has already replied. So this
 * reading is emitted as `upstreamCache` and worded as the dependency's cache — a
 * project with no CDN of its own must never be shown a dependency's cache
 * performance under the words "your host". This project's own hosting verdict
 * is read by the browser kit, where the reply really is served by this site.
 *
 * WHAT IS READ, EXACTLY
 * ---------------------
 * A fixed, code-defined list of header NAMES (below). Nothing else is read —
 * no address, no path, no other header, no body. The header's value is matched
 * against a fixed table of the platform's own words ("HIT", "MISS", …) and
 * immediately discarded; only a counter moves. An unrecognised word counts as
 * nothing at all, so a platform we do not know cannot be turned into a
 * confident verdict.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTERS ARE SPLIT THE WAY THEY ARE
 * -------------------------------------------
 * A reply the platform deliberately refuses to cache (`BYPASS`, `DYNAMIC`) is
 * not waste — a personalised page SHOULD be served fresh. So bypasses are
 * counted and shown but kept OUT of the share: the share is "of the replies
 * the platform treated as cacheable, how many did it actually serve from
 * cache". A miss there is a reply fetched fresh that need not have been, which
 * is exactly the money story.
 *
 * ABSTENTION
 * ----------
 * No verdict header, an unknown platform, a plain origin with no CDN in front
 * of it — all produce nothing. The reading is absent (never a zero) until
 * enough cacheable replies have actually declared themselves.
 *
 * Twin of `lib/boosthis-runtime-web/src/edgeCache.ts`: same verdict
 * vocabulary, same thresholds, same emitted field shape. Duplicated rather
 * than shared because each kit ships with zero runtime dependencies.
