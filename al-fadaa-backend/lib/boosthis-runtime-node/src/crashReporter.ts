/* ─── Boosthis: privacy-safe crash reporter (Node) ───────────────────
 *
 * Faithful port of `lib/boosthis-runtime-rn/src/crashReporter.ts`, adapting
 * ONLY the install layer to Node. Captures REAL uncaught crashes from the host
 * process and turns each one into a tiny, scrubbed fingerprint that is safe to
 * send off-process. This is NOT a perf checklist rule — it is a separate
 * always-on channel (for registered apps) that installs once from
 * `enableTelemetry` and reports on its own. Nothing here runs as an import
 * side-effect; `installCrashHandlers()` must be called explicitly.
 *
 * INSTALL LAYER — Node-specific, guest-code-safe:
 * We hook ONLY `process.on('uncaughtExceptionMonitor', (err, origin) => …)`.
 * The `uncaughtExceptionMonitor` event is a passive MONITOR: unlike an
 * `'uncaughtException'` or `'unhandledRejection'` listener, it does NOT suppress
 * Node's default crash behavior — after our monitor runs, Node still prints the
 * stack and exits exactly as it would with no Boosthis present. We therefore
 * NEVER add an `'uncaughtException'` or `'unhandledRejection'` listener, because
 * doing so would silence the host's crash flow (a drop-in library must not change
 * host behavior). `origin` is `'uncaughtException' | 'unhandledRejection'`, which
 * we map into the server's closed crash-kind enum
 * (`uncaught | unhandledRejection | render`).
 *
 * PRIVACY: the DEFAULT payload carries only the error type, a hashed signature,
 * a redacted top frame, and a bucketed count — never source, values, or PII.
 * OPT-IN detailed mode (per app) additionally carries a PII-scrubbed first
 * message line (`summary`) and sanitized stack `frames` (function + file
 * BASENAME + line/col — absolute paths, URLs, query strings and arguments are
 * stripped in-process). `summary` and any frame that trips the PII guard are
 * dropped individually so the rest of the crash still reports. The field names
 * deliberately avoid the PII denylist (no `message`/`text`/`body`).
 *
 * Crash-safety: every entry point is wrapped in try/catch so a bug in the
 * reporter itself can never crash the host, and the monitor handler NEVER
 * throws (Node treats a throw from the monitor as fatal). The capture/flush path
 * persists pending crashes SYNCHRONOUSLY (fs.writeFileSync via storage) so a
 * FATAL crash (which kills the process before the network flush completes) is
 * still reported on the next launch.
