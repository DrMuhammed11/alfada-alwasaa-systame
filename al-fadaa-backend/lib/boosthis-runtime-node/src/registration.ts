/**
 * "Is THIS install on file with Boosthis?" — the one answer the in-app panel
 * and the standalone status page are allowed to render a registration verdict
 * from. Port of the browser kit's `registration.ts`, word for word in its
 * state machine so the two kits can never disagree about what "registered"
 * means.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 * ----------------------
 * Every surface used to decide "registered" from process-local state alone:
 * this process holds a delete token. That is true of the process that first
 * registered and false of every restart that could not read its store, of a
 * second worker in a cluster, and of a container that came up with a cold
 * disk. Same live install, two contradictory verdicts, and only one can be
 * true. Worse, the panel is what an assisting AI reads to decide whether it is
 * done: a false "not registered" makes the AI change the install line's id,
 * which mints a second install, which the panel also calls not registered.
 *
 * A verdict about the SERVER's records has to come from the server. This
 * module holds that answer in FIVE internal states so a real negative can be
 * told apart from an unanswered question:
 *
 *   pending      no answer yet (the check has not run, or is in flight)
 *   registered   we asked (or registered) and the install IS on file
 *   unregistered we asked and it is NOT on file / the key was refused
 *   throttled    we asked and were rate-limited — a temporary, self-clearing
 *                refusal the kit is already waiting out
 *   unreachable  we asked and could not get an answer at all
 *
 * `throttled` exists because it and `unreachable` need OPPOSITE reactions. A
 * server we cannot reach is a fault to investigate — check egress, TLS, the
 * endpoint. A throttle is us being told to wait, by a server that is working
 * perfectly, with a deadline attached. Recording both as "cannot tell" sent
 * developers hunting for a network fault that did not exist.
 *
 * The public verdict collapses `pending`, `throttled` and `unreachable` into
 * `"unknown"`: three outcomes, never two, so an unanswered check can never be
 * shown as a failed install and can never carry the claim that nothing is
 * being sent. A throttled install genuinely is unknown — we were refused
 * before anyone looked at our records.
 *
 * Never throws into the host: every entry point is self-guarded, and a failed
 * probe degrades to `unreachable`.
