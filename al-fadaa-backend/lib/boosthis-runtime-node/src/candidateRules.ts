/* ─── Boosthis: candidate rules (Node port) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A "candidate rule" is a recurring performance signature that Boosthis has
 * observed but which does NOT map to any rule in the existing rule book. When
 * the same kind of finding fires repeatedly, that's a strong signal there's a
 * real, generalizable perf pattern worth turning into a named rule.
 *
 * Faithful port of `lib/boosthis-runtime-rn/src/candidateRules.ts`. The only
 * difference is storage: RN persists through its platform abstraction; Node
 * persists through `./storage` (a JSON file under ~/.boosthis, like the Python
 * package). The privacy contract is identical:
 *
 *   1. A finding is hashed into a signature — NO route names (which may carry
 *      user data), NO values, NO code. Just kind + bucketed severity + count.
 *   2. If the same signature is seen >= MIN_OCCURRENCES times locally, it
 *      surfaces as a candidate rule.
 *   3. If — and ONLY if — the app has registered telemetry, the signature is
 *      auto-submitted the moment it crosses the threshold. No unreviewed rule
 *      is ever auto-shipped: the maintainer review is what promotes a
 *      candidate into the real rule book. See PRIVACY.md.
