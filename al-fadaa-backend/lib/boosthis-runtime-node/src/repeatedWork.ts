/* ─── Boosthis: repeated-work detector (Node) ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The rule book already tells developers not to redo the same work inside one
 * request (`n-plus-one-orm-query`, `node-fanout-overload`: "identical
 * downstream GETs within one request should share one promise"). Nothing
 * MEASURED it: a span that reaches the server carries a route label, a
 * duration and a rating — never a query, a URL, or an argument — so the server
 * can see that two calls happened but never that they were the SAME call.
 *
 * The counting therefore has to happen HERE, where the real call exists, and
 * only a number may leave.
 *
 * WHAT IS WATCHED. Every call the kit can see the INPUTS of:
 *   • `trackPerf(name, fn)(...args)` — name + arguments are both visible.
 *   • outbound HTTP — the undici observation point liveDetectors already
 *     subscribes to (method + origin + path), paired create → headers/error so
 *     the call's duration is known.
 * `perf(name, fn)` is deliberately NOT watched: it has no visible inputs, so
 * two `perf("db.load_user")` blocks may be two DIFFERENT users. Calling that a
 * repeat would be a lie, and this meter would rather stay quiet.
 *
 * IDENTITY. A call's identity is a 32-bit FNV-1a hash of a bounded local
 * rendering of its target plus its arguments. The rendering is built on the
 * stack, hashed, and dropped: the text, the URL and the argument values are
 * never stored, never logged and NEVER leave this process. Only counts and
 * durations are reported.
 *
 * REQUEST SCOPE. A request's calls are collected in a per-request scope the
 * middleware opens around `next()`. The scope is carried by AsyncLocalStorage
 * (Node's own request-scoped carrier), and the middleware also holds the scope
 * TOKEN directly, so the close always pairs with the open even though the
 * `finish`/`close` listener runs outside the async context. A declined open
 * (the kill-switch, or a shim that lacks AsyncLocalStorage) returns null, and
 * every later call with a null token is a no-op.
 *
 * HONEST WHEN BLIND. A kit that identified no calls at all reports NOTHING —
 * the axis is omitted and the dashboard says "cannot tell". A kit that watched
 * real calls and found no repeat reports a real zero.
 *
 * PRIVACY: counts, durations and one non-reversible in-process hash. No route
 * label, no host, no URL, no argument value. In-memory, bounded, and a no-op
 * under the kill-switch.
 *
 * LATER WORK — the remaining SERVER kits. This ships in Node and Python first
 * because both already have a wrapper that sees a call's inputs plus an
 * outbound observation point to reuse. Go, Java, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Rust and
 * Elixir each need the same two things located in their own kit before the
 * axis can be honest there; until then they simply do not upload it, which
 * reads as "cannot tell" rather than a zero. The phone and browser kits are
 * out of scope: they wrap no calls of this shape.
